						  			<hr>
						  			<p style="color:yellow">Airline, the world's fourth-largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger-kilometers flown and number of international passengers carried, was founded in 1985 by the royal family of Dubai. The airline's first flight was from Dubai to Karachi, Pakistan and Mumbai, India in October of that year. Its first aircraft were provided by Pakistan International. The airline grew rapidly through partnerships and investment to become one of the world's leading air carriers.</p>
						  			<h2 style="color:white;">Incorporation and growth: 1993â€“1999</h2>
						  			<hr>
						  			<p style="color:yellow">By the early 1990s, Airlines was among the world's fastest-growing airlines; revenue increased approximately US$100 million each year, approaching US$500 million in the year 1993. The airline carried 1.6 million passengers and 68,000 tons of cargo in the same year. By 1995, the airline expanded the fleet to six Airbus A300s and eight Airbus A310s and built the network up to cover 37 destinations in 30 countries. In 1996, the airline received its first Boeing 777-200 aircraft, and was followed shortly thereafter by six Boeing 777-200ERs. The arrival of the 777s allowed Airlines to continue its Singapore service onward to Melbourne commencing in 1996. </p>
						  			<h2 style="color:white;">Aircrafts</h2>
						  			<hr>
						  			<p style="color:yellow">In April 2000, Airlines announced an order for the Airbus A3XX (later named Airbus A380), the largest widebody airliner ever built. The deal consisted of five A380-800 passenger aircraft and two freighter versions. On 20 November 2005, Airlines ordered 42 Boeing 777s, to help with its expansion. This order came one day after Airbus announced the A380-800 would be delayed by another six months. Airlines is the largest operator of the A380, with the 100th A380 joining its fleet in November 2017.</p>
